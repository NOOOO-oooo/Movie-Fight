# Movie-Fight
Two movies get compared based on certain statistics taken from an API.


This is a project from a Java Script course.

I learned how to interact with data and how to use axios to make HTTP requests using JavaScript in this project, I used the OMDB API to extract data from.

The comparisson between the two movies happen based on a couple of factors:
1)Number of awards
2)BoxOffice earnings.
3)MetaScore.
4)IMDB Rating.
5)IMDB votes.

And the code in index.js compares between the two values of each section and gives a final score.

I also learned how to make an auto correct system which shows search suggestions close to what we are searching for.
It depends on a root value, and an input value which the user types in each section, and fetched data which comes from the API, once the user clicks on a certain selection from the dropdown menu the list hides and the movie is set for comparisson.

which I won't make again because it was so hard to make using vanilla JS.
